# Popular-Movies
This Android application serves as the submission to the Android Developer Nanodegree Assignment #3 - Popular Movies (stage 2).

## Getting started
In order to use the app you need to set the constant `API_KEY` in the MainActivity.
If you don't have an API key for [TheMovieDB.org](https://themoviedb.org) you can follow the instructions
described in the [documentaion](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

Apart from the missing API key, everything should work with `Android Studio` and the `Gradle wrapper` that comes with this repository.
